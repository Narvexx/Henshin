<h1>Henshin - Giraph Code Generator Example: Movies</h1>

<p>
This is an example for the Giraph code generator in Henshin. It is described
in the paper <i>Implementing Graph Transformations in the Bulk Synchronous
Parallel Model</i> submitted to FASE 2014.
</p>

<p>
The original example consists of a transformation on a part of the
data found in the IMDB movie database. We use here the simplified metamodel
schon below.

<p>
The goal is to find all persons (actors or actresses) that starred together
in at least three movies. For every such pair we want to create an instance
of the Couple class and add links to the movies the couple played in. Note that
this is a simplified version with the following limitations: 1) due to symmetry
we actually create 2 couple object for every pair of persons, and 2) we do not 
consider attributes, such as actor / actress names or movie ratings.
For this simplified task, we use the rules and the sequential unit shown below.

<p>
To generate the Giraph code, right-click on the sequential unit and select
<i>Generate Giraph Code</i>. This will generate two classes: one general 
utility class and one class for this particular transformation. You can
find the generated classes in the
<a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/henshin/org.eclipse.emft.henshin.git/tree/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.henshin.examples/giraph/movies/">giraph/movies</a> folder
in the examples plugin.
